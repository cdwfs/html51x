CACHE MANIFEST

# This section lists files that should be cached locally. It must include
# ALL files that should be cached. This can be tedious to maintain; tools
# like manifestR (http://westciv.com/tools/manifestR/) automate the busywork.
CACHE:
# pages
/week6.html

# This section indicates that all remaining files should ALWAYS be
# loaded from the network every time they're accessed. Any files that
# can't be accessed will cause the FALLBACK file to be displayed
# instead. A wilcard (*) means "always load all files not explicitly
# mentioned in the CACHE or FALLBACK section.
NETWORK:
*

# This section lists files to display if a NETWORK resource can not be
# accessed, or is missing from the cache. Each line has a partial URL
# ("/" means "everything under the root) and a file to display for missing
# resources matching that URL.
FALLBACK:
/ /week6-offline.html
# Could also specify missing images
/images/ /images/missing.png
